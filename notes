USB UART notes:
on sys_hw_type == 3, USB UART is 4, otherwise it is 3
serial UART is 4 also on sys_hw_type == 3

interfaces:
0 = USB
1 = RS232
2 = GPIB
3 = LAN

on sys_hw_type == 3, to mux UART4:
gpio_set(0x15, 0) for RS232 (2009803c <- 00040000) FIO1CLR.18
gpio_set(0x15, 1) for USB   (20098038 <- 00040000) FIO1SET.18
